# Infinity Runner

A simple endless runner game built in Unity to demonstrate Zenject dependency injection.

## Overview

## Features

- Mouse/touch controls for left/right movement
- Endless obstacle generation
- Simple collision detection
- Game over and restart system

## Technical Focus

This project was created primarily to practice and demonstrate **Zenject dependency injection** patterns in Unity. The game mechanics are intentionally minimal to keep focus on the DI architecture.

## Controls

- **Mouse**: Click and drag to move player
- **Touch**: Tap and drag to move player

## Requirements

- Unity 6
- Zenject package

##  Note

This is a learning project focused on dependency injection implementation. No audio or visual included.
